Welcome to the house of the **bootstrap.sh** script to turn your Raspberry Pi into a small WAN emulator!

The goal of this project is to have the Raspberry Pi turned into a small one-arm router that can be used to emulate WAN impairments like variable delay, jitter and packet loss, for SD-WAN demos.

The raspberry sits between the actual CPE router and the SD-WAN gateway, providing two links (VLAN 4094 and VLAN 4093) that can be managed independently, as shown below:

## Prerequisites - Important!

This emulator is managed through *telegram*. To be able to issue orders to your emulator and get feedback, you will need to create a [telegram chat bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

Don't worry, you don't need to code. Just follow the instructions in the link above to name your bot and get your API key. Once you have your API key, keep reading.

## Quick Start

After you have created your [telegram chat bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) (and got the API key for the bot), just download the script to your raspberry pi, and run it:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArubaIberia/piwem/master/bootstrap.sh

chmod 0755 bootstrap.sh

sudo ./bootstrap.sh
```

The script should work best in a freshly installed [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian), either the lite or desktop version.
It will download the required packages and ask for the API key during the process.

You are also given a few options during installation, such as creating a new admin user, or removing the built-in "pi" user. Do whatever suits you better, neither of that is mandatory. 

## Controlling your emulator

Your bot should be online few seconds after you reboot the Raspberry (provided the Raspberry gets internet connectivity). Search your bot by name in telegram and add it to your contact list. Then send any message (try sending the word "ip"), and wait for the bot to greet you!

The code of the bot is also [shared on github](https://github.com/ArubaIberia/ipbot). Please have a look there for a quick introduction to the commands the bot accepts.

## Upgrading the bot

Occassionally, some bugfix in the ipbot code may require that you upgrade to a new version. `bootstrap.sh` is still your friend for this, just make sure you download the latest version of the script and run it with the `-u` (or `--upgrade`) parameter:

```
rm -f bootstrap.sh

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArubaIberia/piwem/master/bootstrap.sh

chmod 0755 bootstrap.sh

sudo ./bootstrap.sh -u
```

Those commands will upgrade and restart the ipbot for you.

## Changing the telegram API key

If you didn't provide the telegram API key during installation, typed it wrong, or want to change it for whatever reason, you can do it by creating/editing the file `/etc/systemd/system/ipbot.service` in your raspberry and setting the key in the `ExecStart` line:

```
[Unit]
Description = IPbot telegram bot for raspi management
After = network.target
[Service]
User = ipbot
ExecStart = /opt/bin/ipbot -token "<your API token>"
[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target
```

If you installed the desktop version of raspbian you probably have a graphical editor available, like *gedit*. Just remember the file is owned by root, so you have to run the editor with *sudo* (`sudo gedit`, for instance).

If you installed the lite version of raspbian then you will have to use a command-line editor such as *vi* or *nano*. I don't believe *nano* comes already installed in the lite version of raspbian, you probably need to install it first (`sudo apt install -y nano; sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/ipbot.service`).

After updating ypur key, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, just in case, and reboot the raspberry.
